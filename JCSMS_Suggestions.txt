I like the way you put comments in your code.

These are my suggestions

1) you can initialize database with few default students so that when we chose option 1) List Students, it will display some names instead of blank output or you can output an
informational message to console like "No Students Found"

2) Same thing with option 5). you can have some default students in each club or output an informational message
with option 6, you can provide a sub menu with numbers for each club so that it is easy to enter numbers than to type the whole club name

3)is it possible to take input from up arrow in the menu so that we don't have to type the same number again if needed

4) In this case, you can throw the message "Student not found" after entering name or ID, instead of asking to Choose a club
Choose an option: 6
Enter student name or ID: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022222222222222222222222222222
Choose a club (Science Olympiad, CS Team, Math Team, TSA, Cyberpatriots): Math Team
Student not found.

5) Not Able to add student to the club if i give the name as 1234

9) when unittests are run, it should display the name of the unit tests ran, instead of saying 2 tests.

savula@savula7670l:~/github/JCSMS$ python3 Unittests/test_student_class.py
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

OK
savula@savula7670l:~/github/JCSMS$

10) if possible, you should add unit tests to each menu item
